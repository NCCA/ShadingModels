#ShadingModels
![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/Shading.png)

A series of examples to demonstrate different shaders and techniques in glsl. Eventually I'm going to replace all of this with a simpler demo as most of the code in these examples is very similar.

Note this branch is an older version and will not be maintained as it uses the old OpenGL widget
